# RARE DOTS
Website to inform our supporters about our NFT project

## About us.
We are a group of students who are running a social experiment to cover our expenses and pay our fees for the university. We have 2000 pieces of unique rare dots NFT which we intend sell at 0.02 ETH as floor price. 
If we hit 20 ETH, then we will use the excess amount to fund exciting future projects in the blockchain eco-system. Each NFT mint counts. :)  

We won't be revealing our identity as our university will expell us. Thank you!
